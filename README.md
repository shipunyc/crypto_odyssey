# crypto_odyssey

Crypto Odyssey is a Pokemon style strategy game. It brings players a unique experience of combating with enemies in the fantasy world of skeletons, goblins, ninjas, and knights.

What's more, all virtual assets, such as characters, items, and weapons are recorded in the TRON blockchain. Also, players are the miners of the COT tokens; the more battles you win, the more tokens you can mine. All in-game purchases are conducted through TRX, and will be eventually returned back to the hands of COT holders.
